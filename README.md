# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

Built the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application =was not deployed, I provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met at the walk through section.
